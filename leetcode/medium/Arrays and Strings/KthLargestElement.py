# Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

# Example 1:

# Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
# Output: 5
# Example 2:

# Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
# Output: 4
# Note:
# You may assume k is always valid, 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ array's length.

# NOTE: Logic is explained in leetcode solns.
