# Contribution

## Steps to contribute

- When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the question/algorithm you wish to add via an issue.
- The folder structure layout is given in the Readme. Please make sure you are maintaining the folder structure when contributing. For example, if you are adding a leetcode medium question which falls under the Dynamic Programming bucket, the solution should go under `leetcode -> medium -> DP`
- This step is not mandatory, but highly recommended. Briefly describe the question/algorithm you are solving in a multiline comment at the top of your file. I personally just copy paste the question straight from leetcode and add it to the top of my python file.
- All solutions should be in either Python or Java.
